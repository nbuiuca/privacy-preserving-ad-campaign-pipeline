This project demonstrates a privacy-preserving marketing workflow on synthetic customer data: it classifies customers into economic groups using income thresholds, randomly assigns campaign offers, generates a reproducible pseudonymous exposure_id using PBKDF2-HMAC (SHA-256 + salt + iterations), removes PII columns, and exports an anonymized CSV for downstream ad exposure/response analysis. No real customer data is used.
